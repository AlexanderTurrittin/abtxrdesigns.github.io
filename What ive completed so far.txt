I spent the majority of my time this week working on the layout and style of my website.

So, the section I tried to get finished this week was the contact page. Theres a couple tweeks 
I want to make but I dont know how to do them at the moment.

Additional Details I did was the parallax scrolling. This one as well has a couple of things
I want to change but couldnt figure out. I also have a few hover effects on the links of the side
navigation bar as well as teh links at the bottom of the page. The links will change color when hovered
over, but will not be underlines or change color after they have been clicked on. Which I had to 
correct in the code because since they are links they could turn purple if they were clicked on.
